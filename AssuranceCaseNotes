Top Level Claims:
  
    1. Keycloak has an acceptable password policy implementation. 
    2. Stored user credentials are protected from unauthorized access. (Dan)
    3. Keycloak is protected against malicious user input. (Glenn)
    4. Administrative access to the server management is controlled. (Chet) 
    5. All Keycloak security vulnerabilities have been sufficiently mitigated. (Kero)
    
    Chet -- We are trying to come up with an assurance claim that addresses the server side of the application. Any ideas??

    Ideas for addl' claims:
     -- Keycloak is adequately protected against known vulnerabilities
     -- something with single sign on
     -- when connected with 3rd party applications -- channels secure
     -- access control to server management processes
