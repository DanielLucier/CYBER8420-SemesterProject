Top Level Claims:
  
    Keycloak has an acceptable password policy implementation. (Kero)
    Stored user credentials are protected from unauthorized access. (Dan)
    Keycloak is protected against malicious user input. (Glenn)
    
    
    Chet -- We are trying to come up with an assurance claim that addresses the server side of the application. Any ideas??

    Ideas for addl' claims:
     -- Keycloak is adequately protected against known vulnerabilities
     -- something with single sign on
     -- when connected with 3rd party applications -- channels secure
     --access control to server management processes
