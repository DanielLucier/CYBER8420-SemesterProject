Top Level Claims:
  
    1. User credentials are transmitted to third party applications over secure channels. (Dan)
    2. Stored user credentials are protected from unauthorized access. (Dan)
    3. Keycloak is protected against malicious user input. (Glenn)
    4. Keycloak minimizes non-administrative users access to the server admin console. (Chet)

    -- We are trying to come up with an assurance claim that addresses the server side of the application. Any ideas??

    Ideas for addl' claims:
     -- Keycloak is adequately protected against known vulnerabilities
     -- something with single sign on
     -- when connected with 3rd party applications -- channels secure
     -- access control to server management processes
