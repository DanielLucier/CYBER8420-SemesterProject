Using Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool 2016 (TMT 2016), Cyber Wardens developed Level 1 data flow diagrams (DFD) to support each of our <a href="https://github.com/DanielLucier/CYBER8420-SemesterProject/tree/master/MisuseCases">misuse cases</a>. We analyzed the DFDs to identify applicable STRIDE threats. We examined each threat automatically identified by TMT 2016 and documented mitigation strategies. A full HTML report was generated using TMT 2016. Finally, we reviewed Keycloak's actual software design for security related issues based on our threat models.
