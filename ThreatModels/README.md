Using Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool 2016 (TMT 2016), Cyber Wardens developed Level 1 data flow diagrams (DFD) to support each of our <a href="https://github.com/DanielLucier/CYBER8420-SemesterProject/tree/master/MisuseCases">misuse cases</a>. We analyzed the DFDs to identify applicable STRIDE threats. We examined each threat automatically identified by TMT 2016 and documented mitigation strategies. A full HTML report was generated using TMT 2016. Finally, we reviewed Keycloak's actual software design for security related issues based on our threat models.

Summary Of Security Related Issues Identified In Keycloak's Software Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the Microsoft threat Modeling Tool we developed a level 1 data flow diagram and found a some possible vulnerabilities along with documented CVE's.

Keycloak is a single processes that has incoming and outgoing data traffic on multiple fronts including: an end user, third party applications, LDAP/Active Directory, client adapters, and a data source. Since Keycloak cannot ensure the security of each of these external interactorâ€™s a single trust boundary has been placed around the Keycloak process to fully protect the main process.
