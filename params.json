  "body": "### Course Description\r\n* Assurance is a reasoned, audit-able argument created to support claimed beliefs about a certain entity\r\n* This course is an intersection of knowledge areas necessary to perform engineering activities relevant for promoting assurance in claims for `Secure Software`.\r\n* This course takes on a software development lifecycle perspective for the prevention of flaws.\r\n\r\n### Instruction\r\n* The course will be conducted through “discussions” and “trying things out”.\r\n* There will be many class-exercises in small groups. \r\n* Familiarity with reading materials will be assessed using in-class quizzes. Students must complete assignments and independent projects as directed. \r\n\r\n### Resource Material\r\n#### Textbooks\r\n_None_. Most readings and supplemental materials will be provided in class. All lecture slides will be made available on blackboard.\r\n\r\n#### Other reading materials\r\n* Secure Coding: Principles and Practice, M.G. Graff & K.R. van Wyk (This is a good book that every software developer must read)\r\n* Building Secure Software, J. Viega & G. McGraw (We will refer to some chapters of this book for security enhancing implementation practices)\r\n* System Assurance: beyond Detecting Vulnerabilities, Mansourov, Nikolai, and Djenana Campara. Elsevier/Morgan Kaufmann, 2011 (Standards based definition and assessment of software weaknesses, creating an assurance argument)\r\n\r\n### Additional References\r\n* Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO, David Wheeler, http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/index.html \r\n* Browser Security Handbook Part 1: https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part1   \r\nand Part 2: https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2 \r\n* Software Assurance in Education, Training and Certification, Pocketguide, Ed.

If you cannot attend class, then it is your duty to follow up with any given instruction, class assignment deadlines and lecture notes. \r\n\t\t\r\n### Policy on Plagiarism\r\nAny exam or assignment material submitted which looks identical in any fashion to another student’s work or external sources will be considered plagiarism. The grade of which will be adjusted to the minimum possible (Zero) for the assignment for all parties involved. Any further offenses will result in an “F” for the course, accompanied by academic dishonesty actions taken by the College Dean. Note carefully the University policy on academic integrity (http://goo.gl/NVWUBy; https://goo.gl/JHfZWW) and code of conduct (http://goo.gl/Ar8Bda).  \r\nMake yourself familiar with writing techniques such that you can cite external sources without plagiarizing. Here is are a few links to writing resources: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/563/01/ https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/589/01/\r\n\r\n### Exams\r\nThere will be a mid term exam, and a final exam. The exams will consist of essay-type questions with only a few multiple choices type questions. These in-class exams are intended to help focus on the important parts in the material, reinforce learning, and provide timely feedback. The exam questions typically have multiple parts, be sure you answer all the parts.\r\n\r\n### In-class Exercises\r\nIn-class exercises will be conducted in stages that correspond to the software development lifecycle. The objective of assignments is to gain hands-on experience in various techniques and tools for software assurance and apply them to build secure software. Details about the assignments will follow as we go further into the semester. Special software programs/tools will be provided to you for some of the assignments. The instructions to turn in the assignment will be provided along with each the assignments. \r\n\r\n### Grading\r\n20% Reading summaries/open discussion and class participation\r\n20% Mid-term\r\n20% Final exam (Comprehensive)\r\n20% In-class Exercises\r\n20% Semester Project and Presentation\r\n\r\n### Course Meeting Schedule\r\nIn this semester there are scheduled ~16 available class periods on Wednesdays for 135 minutes each. Accounting for in-class exams, project presentations, snow days, instructor travel to conferences and the like we will actually have something closer to 10-11 class periods for instruction. \r\n\r\nDue to the current and advanced nature of this class, it is under constant revision! So you can expect some experimentation and shuffling of the course topics as we progress through the semester. Constructive feedback on the content is highly encouraged.\r\n\r\n### Book Keeping\r\nPut your name, date and class identification and page number on all your assignments and any correspondence with me. All email sent to me regarding the class must have the class descriptor and your name in the subject field e.g. (IASC/CSCI 8420 - TOPIC). We will be using blackboard for the course.\r\n\r\n### Contact Information\r\nSee Blackboard.\r\n\r\n",
