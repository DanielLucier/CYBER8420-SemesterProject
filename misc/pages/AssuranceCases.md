CYBER 8420 Assurance Cases
==========================
CyberWardens was tasked with building assurance cases for Keycloak. 

First, we established five top level assurance claims for Keycloak:
<ul>
  <li>User credentials are transmitted to third party applications over secure channels.</li>
  <li>Stored user credentials are protected from unauthorized access.</li>
  <li>Sanitizing the input values from adding a new user minimizes the possibility of maliciously affecting Keycloak.</li>
  <li>Keycloak minimizes non-administrative users access to the server admin console.</li>
  <li>Keycloak is protected against brute force attacks.</li>
 </ul>

Next, we developed an assurance case for each top level assurance claim through Lucidchart.
