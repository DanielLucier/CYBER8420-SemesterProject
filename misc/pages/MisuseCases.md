description: CYBR 8420 Misuse Cases
---

CyberWardens created misuses cases to address the top level assurance claims identified through the <a href="https://daniellucier.github.io/CYBER8420-SemesterProject/misc/pages/AssuranceCases.html">Assurance Cases</a> exercise. A diagram for each misuse case was developed in Lucidchart. 

**Misuse Cases and corresponding Assurance Case/s:**
<ul>
  <li>Misuse Case 1 elaborates on Assurance Case 1 - User credentials are transmitted to third party applications over secure channels.</li>
  <li>Misuse Case 2 elaborates on Assurance Case 2 - Stored user credentials are protected from unauthorized access.</li>
  <li>Misuse Case 3 elaborates on the combination of Assurance Cases 3 and 4 - Keycloak minimizes non-administrative user access to the server admin console and prevents users from acting maliciously by sanitizing input during new user creation.</li>
  <li>Misuse Case 4 elaborates on Assurance Case 5 - Keycloak is protected against brute force attacks.</li>
</ul>
