# Team Semester Project

This class strives to encourage learning by doing and making a real difference to the practice of building software. To turn this spirit into reality, a semester long project will require you to work with a open source software project. A group of three to four students will select a unique open source software project and contribute security related improvements.

The project will have the following deliverables:

1. **Project Proposal**: 2-3 page report that describes the following:
  * Open source project description (What is it?, Contributors, Activity, Use, Popularity, Languages used, platform, documentation sources, etc.)
  * [Discuss License, procedures for making contributions, and contributor agreements](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#orienting-yourself-to-a-new-project)
  * Security related history (E.g. known vulnerabilities)
  * Functional security requirements for the software
  * Your motivation for selecting this project
  * Link to your team github repository that shows your [project](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) [plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) and internal collaboration
1. **Assurance Cases Software Security Engineering**: A short report that includes the following:
  * 5 assurance claims that would require evidence from software security engineering activities
  * Build 5 assurance cases; one for each of the claims
1. **Requirements for Software Security Engineering**: 2-3 page report that describes the following:
  * Identify security requirements based on assurance claims
  * Document security requirements for the project captured using mis-use case diagrams
  * Include links to Lucidchart diagrams with brief descriptions in the document
  * Review project documentation for security related configuration and installation
1. **Designing for Software Security Engineering**: 2-3 page report that describes the following:
  * Develop threat models for critical data-flows through the software captured in mis-use cases
  * Include diagrams   
  * Discuss alignment of threat models with actual software design
1. **Code analysis for Software Security Engineering**: 2-3 page report that describes the following:
  * Code review strategy
  * Automated code scanning results summary. Include links to full reports.
  * Summary of key findings
  * Links to pull requests to the original project and any follow-up interactions.
1. **Class Presentation**: 10-minute class presentation that highlights the following:
  * Project description
  * Assurance claims
  * Gaps in security requirements and design of the original project
  * Findings from code review and automated software scanning
  * Contributions to the original project (documentation, design changes, code changes, communications)

## Project Inspiration
* [Github guide for contributing to Open Source Projects](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute)
* [Openhub](https://www.openhub.net) by Black Duck Software
* Github [search](https://github.com/search) and [trends](https://github.com/trending).
* DHS SWAMP listing for [public software packages](https://www.mir-swamp.org/#packages/public).
* [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com)
* Some blogs to consider. [blog 1](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/getting-involved-open-source-projects), [blog 2](https://help.github.com/articles/where-can-i-find-open-source-projects-to-work-on/), [blog 3](http://www.firsttimersonly.com)

## Projects to Avoid
* In-active projects (no recent contributions, no activity on forums, lack of wiki or documentation)
* Old vulnerable project versions
* Android Apps
* Projects with languages that do not have a lot of tool support
* Project with little or no functional security requirements. As surprising as it may sound, not all software have security needs!
* Projects not accepting contributions
